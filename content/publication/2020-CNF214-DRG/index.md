abstract: Coupled reduced mechanisms were developed for the hetero-/homogeneous combustion of fuel-lean and fuel-rich H2/CO/O2/N2 mixtures in a Pt-coated planar channel, using a method based on the Directed Relation Graph (DRG) and for a wide range of operating conditions for which detailed measurements are available. It is demonstrated that catalytic and gas-phase reaction mechanisms can be reduced to- gether for all the fuel-lean cases. On the other hand, when joint reduction is performed for low-pressure fuel-rich cases (using a strict threshold value to capture the relatively weak, yet still important coupling between the catalytic and gas-phase reaction pathways) the result is a less efficient reduction process. For the high-pressure fuel-rich cases the catalytic-gaseous chemical coupling is weak enough to be neglected such that the reduction can be conducted separately for higher reduction efficiency. The reduced mech- anisms reproduced well the major gaseous species concentrations, gas temperatures and homogeneous ignition distances obtained with the detailed mechanisms, thus demonstrating the capacity of the applied method in reducing catalytic/gas-phase reaction mechanisms. In addition, it is shown that for fuel-lean stoichiometries the reduction could provide a rapid indication if gas-phase combustion is ignited, without the need of full simulations. The reduced mechanisms are expected to facilitate large-scale simulations, with fidelity, for the design and thermal management of practical catalytic combustion systems.
